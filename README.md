**Octopus** is an open-source microservice architecture tool for visualizing dependency graph. It's simple and easy to use.

# Why

The microservice architecture has a lot of advantages but there are a lot disadvantages too. One of the main problem is that it can easily get out of control because of the quantity of the moving pieces.

**Octopus** aims to solve some of that issue by providing an overall dependency graph between microservices.

- you need it to paint the big picture. Donâ€™t underestimate the value of seeing the big picture because you definitely need it even if you are not doing the architecture on daily basis
- you also need this to do some impact analysis
